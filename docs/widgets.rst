Widgets
=======

Samlab widgets are small user interface components that are created and
arranged by users of the :ref:`manager`.  Each widget provides a single
component for displaying, modifying, or visualizing information.  Widgets -
some of which have parameters that can be set at creation - are created
interactively by the user, or programmatically through the :ref:`python-api` or
:ref:`javascript-api`.
