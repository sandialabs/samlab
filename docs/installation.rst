Installation
============

Using Pip / Easy Install
------------------------

If your package manager doesn't support Samlab, or doesn't have the latest
version, your next option should be Python setup tools like `pip`.  You can
always install the latest stable version of Samlab and its required
dependencies using::

    $ pip install samlab

... following that, you'll be able to use all of Samlab's features.


From Source
-----------

Finally, if you want to work with the latest, bleeding-edge Samlab goodness,
you can install it using the source code::

    $ git clone https://github.com/sandialabs/samlab
    $ cd samlab
    $ sudo python setup.py install

The setup script installs Samlab's required dependencies and copies Samlab into
your Python site-packages directory, ready to go.
